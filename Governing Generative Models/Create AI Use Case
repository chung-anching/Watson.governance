**APIC Workshop Lab 2 - The Developer Portal Experience**

In this lab, we will take the API created in Lab 1 and publish it to a
Developer Portal, ready for consumption by app developers. We will begin
by creating a new catalog and configuring the developer portal for our
HotelReview product. We will then define a new plan in the product and
publish to our new developer portal.

In this tutorial, you will explore the following key capabilities:

-   Configure the Developer Portal and publish the APIs.

-   Create a Portal Account.

-   Create App and Subscribe to Plan.

-   Test API in the Developer Portal
